  probably a linear search on the array to find the next empty position would be fine

pin:
  not working
  
remove/reduce JSON dependency using pure JS

gifbot

extend avatar into an !info command that displays more information on the user

artchannel:
  maybe check if Lucasmaster and Heartwell's messages contain an image before reacting

logs:
  we should have a logfile so that we can see what happened on crashes

listquotes:
  display them in a better way
