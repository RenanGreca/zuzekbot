API changed:
  changed the API for a far better one with many more utilities
  this inevitably led to changes throughout the whole code
  some parts now may need refactoring because it was faster to interface with the new api in a hacky way
  some of the changes below are kinda consequences of this big one

variables renamed:
  some variables needed a name that represented their new API equivalent better

const and let:
  replaced 'var' with 'const' and 'let' to make it clear when the variable can't be reassigned

more checks:
  in some places calling the command with no arguments given made no sense and it's now detected and reported

slap:
  if provided with no arguments, user slaps the air
  also, now the slapped thing is bold

diceroll:
  if provided with no arguments assumes input to be 6; the size of a regular dice

testServer:
  I created a server where I'm testing things
  I tried to keep any code that was used in that out of this codebase but somethings might still be here

bugfixes:
  in a few instances empty messages were being sent to the API and that returned errors

translation:
  !help was translated to portuguese. Only the commands are in english now

!help:
  some of the descriptions were improved (hopefully)

embeds:
  Bot uses pretty RichEmbeds

gemeos:
  new command!

typebot:
  new feature. Sometimes the bot will start typing something and then stop without sending a message

art-channel:
  automatically reacts with :hammer: :guigas: on every Heartwell and Discord post

more:
  honestly it was so much I don't remember everything
  some changes might be there because of personal preferences and I kinda just did them without much thought
